Description: Sample size estimations for MRMC studies based on the Obuchowski-Rockette (OR) methodology is implemented. The function can calculate sample sizes where the 
             endpoint of interest in the study is either ROC AUC (Area-Under-the-Receiver-Operating-Characteristics-Curve) or sensitivity. The package can also return sample sizes for studies
             expected to have clustering effect (eg.- multiple pulmonary nodules per patient). All calculations assume that the study design is fully crossed (paired-reader, paired-case) where
             each reader reads/interprets each case (eg.- Chest X-ray image) and there are two intereventions/imaging-modalities/techniques in the study.
